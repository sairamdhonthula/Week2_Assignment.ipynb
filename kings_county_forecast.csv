Problem Statement
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needs ‚Äî especially charging stations.
Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impact user satisfaction, and hinder sustainability goals.

This project builds a regression model to forecast future EV adoption demand, based on historical trends in EV growth, vehicle types, and regional (county-level) data.

Goal
‚úÖ Use the provided dataset to predict the number of electric vehicles (EVs) in future months/years.
‚úÖ Help urban planners make better decisions about charging infrastructure needs.
‚úÖ Provide historical vs forecasted EV growth insights at the county level.

Dataset
We used the dataset published by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) which contains monthly EV registration records.
